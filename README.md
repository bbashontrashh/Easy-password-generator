<h1>Welcome to my first REPO </h1>
<p>This is just a simple script to make random passwords with the inputs of diferente numers or names.</p>
<h1>How it Works?</h1>
<p>Well, its so ez. you just put a few words or numbers, like dates of birth, names, colors, etc. Then the script will make random choices and will create a x number of possible combinations. In some ez password it works well. For example if his password is Bash2000 and you put on the input bash and 2000, 100% of the time you will find the password</p>
